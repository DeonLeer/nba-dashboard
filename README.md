# NBA Dashboard

NBA Dashboard is an advanced analytics app made with React.js on the front end and Express on the back end. The data is processed from NBA and ESPN APIs and visualized using Material UI. Features include a homepage with game scores, standings and league leaders page, and an individual player page which shows a variety of player stats, including a shot map for the current season. Project built by Deon Leer, Colin Elsinga and Khanduulga Munkhbold in February 2021.
